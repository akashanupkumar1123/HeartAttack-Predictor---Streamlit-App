## 🔬 Project Overview

The **HeartAttack Predictor** is an interactive **Streamlit** web application designed to assist healthcare practitioners and users in assessing the risk of heart attacks based on patient clinical data. The app leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including feature engineering and model inference, to generate real-time risk predictions.

This application combines the power of machine learning algorithms with an intuitive user interface to provide instant cardiovascular risk assessments based on multiple clinical parameters including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, chest pain type, and other critical health indicators.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🏥 **Medical-Grade Interface:** Clean, professional UI designed for healthcare environments
- 🤖 **Real-Time Predictions:** Leveraging ensemble models (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) for instant risk scoring
- 📊 **Data Visualizations:** Interactive charts showing risk factors, probability distributions, and feature importance
- 🧠 **Model Explainability:** SHAP values and feature importance to understand prediction drivers
- ⚙️ **Customizable Thresholds:** Adjustable decision boundaries for different clinical scenarios
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly interface accessible on all devices
- 🔒 **Privacy-Focused:** No data storage - all processing happens locally
- 📈 **Performance Metrics:** Display of model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores
- 💾 **Export Functionality:** Download predictions and visualizations as PDF reports
